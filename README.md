# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Analysis Overview

### Problem Statement: 
Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. 

### Methodology: 
For this challenge, I employed different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. I used the imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.

Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, I oversampled the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersampled the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, I used a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. 

Lastly, I compared two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. Below, youâ€™ll see my evaluation of the performance of these models and my recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

## Summary of the model results + recommendations

Of the six different algorithms we tested, the first 4 did not perform as well as the last two. The Easy Ensemble model performed the best, by far. I would recommend using the Easy Ensemble algorithm if they are choosing from the 6 we tested. That being said, it would be helpful to understand the baseline/goal accuracy, precision and recall scores that the bank is targeting as a minimum viable product. 

Something else for them to consider would be their appetite for using a mix of machine learning and manual reviews. They could use machine learning to weed out the applications that are most clearly high/low risk and have the more middle-ground applications get reviewed by a manual review team if they want to absolutely reduce business risk and client insult.
